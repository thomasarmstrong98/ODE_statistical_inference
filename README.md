# thirdyearproj
This repository contains a set of notebooks created for the third year project for my BSc in Mathematics at the University of York. The project is titled "Statistical Inference for Differential Equations". For this project, I am trying to infere parameter values from differential equations. I will be taking a Bayesian approach to my project and intend to make use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques.

Note:
Some of these notebooks feature animated plots to display how inference changes with each observation. Such plots cannot be displayed on GitHub and must be ran locally. To do so, FFmpeg must be installed and \FFmpeg\bin added to PATH.

Structure of Notebook:

Grid Estimation
  Coin Toss Example
  One Parameter Logistic Equation 
  Two Parameter Normal Distribution
  Two Parameter Logistic Equation
  
MCMC
