# thirdyearproj
This repository contains a set of notebooks created for the third year project for my BSc in Mathematics at the University of York. The project is titled "Statistical Inference for Differential Equations". For this project, I am trying to infere parameter values from differential equations. I will be taking a Bayesian approach to my project and intend to make use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques.

#### Note:
Some of these notebooks feature animated plots to display how inference changes with each observation. Such plots cannot be displayed on GitHub and must be ran locally. To do so, FFmpeg must be installed and \FFmpeg\bin added to PATH.

### Structure of Notebook:

#### Grid Estimation 
- Coin Toss Example, [here](https://github.com/thomasarmstrong98/thirdyearproj/blob/master/bayesian_coin_toss_bias.ipynb)
- One Parameter Logistic Equation, [here](https://github.com/thomasarmstrong98/thirdyearproj/blob/master/bayesian_logistic_eqn_grid.ipynb)
- Two Parameter Normal Distribution, [here](https://github.com/thomasarmstrong98/thirdyearproj/blob/master/grid_approx_two_param_normal.ipynb)
- Two Parameter Logistic Equation
  
#### MCMC
